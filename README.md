🐶 **The Watchdog**

*Holding Power Accountable in Boston, Kentucky*

**About This Project:**

*The Watchdog* began as a simple web development practice assignment, but it quickly became something deeply personal.

This project is inspired by the very real and ongoing struggles in my small Kentucky community, where local families, including my own, continue to be directly affected by corporate developments and irreversible environmental changes.

What started as a coding exercise has evolved into a passion project with a mission:
to give a *voice* to a powerless community, and to hold power accountable when multi-million dollar bourbon companies (whose name is being kept mostly anonymous...for now 😈) **bulldoze** through small towns without transparency, compassion, or care for the people who live there.

While this version of *The Watchdog* is a simple prototype, I fully intend to turn it into a fully functional journalistic exposé site in the future. The long-term goal is to provide a home for investigative storytelling, citizen reports, and local accountability journalism. 

**Features:**

- "Whistle at The Dog": a form for residents to log concerns and experiences

- "Subscribe Section": an email form with checkboxes and dropdowns for topic and frequency preferences.
- "Responsive Styling": clean layout using semantic HTML and custom CSS
- "JavaScript Data Model": uses arrays, objects, and loops to simulate a real subscriber section (🤞🏻)

**Lessons Learned:**

This project gave me the opportunity to connect my personal convictions with practical programming skills. While HTML and CSS are the easier and more fun aspects of programming, I was eager to put some JavaScript concepts to practical use, as it is what I need to most practice. For me at this stage in my journey, it requires a lot of trial and error, Googling, YouTubing, and consulting, often with AI, on how to correct my syntax in order to achieve my output goal. I am confident that after enough practice,  the syntax will come more naturally to me (though probably never as natural as HTML and CSS 🥲). 
The lesson that stuck out to me the most on this journey, however, is to ALWAYS check the Console Log in DevTools before committing, because the browser will catch errors that VS Code did not... I'm looking at you, "button type" tag 😅.

**Future Vision for *The Watchdog:***

*The Watchdog* will grow into a community-driven news platform that collects local stories, visual evidence, and investigative articles to expose environmental, ethical, and corporate injustices that might otherwise go unseen.

It's more than a project - it's a promise to speak up for those who have been silenced. 🐶
